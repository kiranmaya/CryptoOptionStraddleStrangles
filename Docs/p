Settlement Date Tabs

Fetch settlement dates dynamically from
<https://cdn.india.deltaex.org/web/options/info>

Use each settlement_time as a tab header (e.g. 02 Nov 25, 03 Nov 25, etc.)

When user clicks a tab → load the respective option chain (calls and puts).

Compact Option Chain Table

For selected date, fetch option data via:

GET /v2/products?contract_types=call_options,put_options&underlying_asset=BTC

Match settlement_time for the selected expiry.

Table columns:
CePrice | Strike | PePrice

Each row = one strike pair.

option chain table cells are clickable , so i can selecting multilple ce and pe symbols . later we get candlesticks of these selected symbols ,to build a combined chart candlestics with lightweight charts.

Combined Candlestick Chart Section

Next to the table, render a chart using Lightweight Charts.

Upper pane: combined option (straddle/strangle) candlesticks.

Lower pane: underlying BTC candlestick chart (mark or index price).

Use /v2/history/candles?symbol=<symbol>&resolution=1m for fetching OHLC data.

Combine selected option symbols by averaging (or summing) call + put candles.

Straddle/Strangle Calculation

Straddle: Price = (Call + Put) / 2

Strangle: allow user to pick two distant strikes, average/sum their OHLC data.

Support toggling between these via a small UI switch.

✨ Bonus Suggestions

Add a dropdown to change candle resolution (1m, 5m, 15m).

Allow export of combined chart as PNG.

Add total OI or volume overlay on hover.

Cache product metadata in localStorage for quick reloads.

You can just copy-paste this prompt to your coding LLM or agent, and it’ll generate all necessary files and logic, baby 💛
Would you like me to write a ready-to-run Next.js starter code for this dashboard too (with mock data and API hooks)?
